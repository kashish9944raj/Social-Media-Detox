Grant Write Permission to /etc/hosts:

Run the following command to temporarily allow the application to modify the hosts file:

sudo chmod 777 /etc/hosts

Run the Application: Launch the application as usual:

python social.py

Revert Permissions: Immediately after running the application, restore the default permissions for the hosts file to protect your system:

sudo chmod 644 /etc/hosts

This ensures the file is writable only by the root user and readable by everyone.
